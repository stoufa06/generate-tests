# GenerateTests

Your package description goes here. Describe what the package does and why it's useful.

## Installation

To install the package, youâ€™ll need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require stoufa06/generate-tests
```

## Usage

After installing the package, you can use the `generate-tests` script from the command line to generate test files for your source code.

### Command Line Options

The script supports several command line options to customize its behavior:

- `--src-directory=<path>`: Specify the source directory containing the PHP files for which tests should be generated. Default is `src`.

- `--tests-directory=<path>`: Specify the output directory where the test files will be generated. Default is `tests`.

- `--backup-list-file=<file>`: Specify a file containing a list of test files that should always be regenerated. Default is `backup_list.txt`.

- `--excluded-folders-file=<file>`: Specify a file listing folders to exclude from test generation. Default is `excluded_folders.txt`.

- `--no-check-marker`: Disable the check for a specific marker in test files. By default, only files containing a '// Generated by script' comment will be regenerated if they already exist.

### Example Usage

```bash
php vendor/bin/generate-tests --src-directory=src --tests-directory=tests --backup-list-file=backup_list.txt --excluded-folders-file=excluded_folders.txt --no-check-marker
```

This command will generate test files for all PHP files within the `src` directory, output them to the `tests` directory, check against `backup_list.txt` and `excluded_folders.txt` for any specific rules, and regenerate any previously scripted files without considering the marker.
